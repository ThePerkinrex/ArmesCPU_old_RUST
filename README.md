# ArmesCPU
This is a implementation of the simulated Armes CPU

A webassembly library is available

The library alone is also available

A python version is available on the `python_version` branch, but I don't think it will be updated as much as the Rust version, because it was a test to see if this kind of thing could be done. Now in Rust, the CPU is faster, the mmaps are direct binary, there's a wasm implementation...
